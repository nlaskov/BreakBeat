## 🔊 Breakpoint Sound

**Breakpoint Sound** is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that plays a customizable sound whenever your debugger hits a breakpoint.

Because sometimes *seeing* the breakpoint isn’t enough — you should **hear it** too.

### ✨ Features

- 🔔 Play a sound when a breakpoint is hit  
- 🎵 Choose your own sound file  
- ⚙️ Simple configuration via IDE Settings  
- 🧠 Works seamlessly with the IntelliJ debugger  
- 🪶 Lightweight, no performance impact

### 🛠 How It Works

When the debugger pauses execution on a breakpoint, the plugin listens for the event and immediately plays the selected sound.  
You can change the sound at any time — even while debugging.

---

### ⚙️ Configuration

Navigate to: Settings → Tools → Breakpoint Sound
From there you can:
- Enable or disable the sound
- Select a custom sound
- Disclamer: Currently there are only 3 test sounds, there will be wider variety soon.

### 🧩 Status Bar Widget

The plugin adds a small widget to the **bottom-right corner of the IDE status bar**.

The widget provides:
- Quick visual feedback that Breakpoint Sound is active
- One-click access to toggle the sound on or off

This makes it easy to control the plugin without leaving your workflow.
